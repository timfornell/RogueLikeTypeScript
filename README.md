# Information
While browsing the web for new projects to do I found a subreddit called /r/roguelikedev which hosts an annual event
where the participants build their own roguelike games. The tutorial can be found
[here](https://rogueliketutorials.com/) and is written for Python 3. One can also find participants from previous events
and their contributions on their
[wiki-page](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series/#wiki_directory_of_participants)

Since I have already done a lot of coding in Python, both at work and on my free time, I wanted to try something new.
Therefore, this project will be written in TypeScript. A programming language I know basically nothing about, apart
from that it can be considered an enhanced version of JavaScript. As can be seen in the previous link, there are already
people who have done this in TypeScript. Which means that this is not an impossible undertaking.

This README file will be written continously as I following along with the tutorial and will be split up into different
chapters which correspond to the different parts from the tutorial.
